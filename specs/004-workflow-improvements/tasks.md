# Tasks: Workflow Improvements and Project Structure Reorganization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-workflow-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not requested in specification - focusing on implementation and validation tasks

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Single C project at repository root
- CI scripts in `.github/scripts/`
- Workflows in `.github/workflows/`
- Documentation in `docs/` with subdirectories
- User tools remain at project root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create directory structure and prepare for reorganization

**Estimated Time**: 15-30 minutes

- [ ] T001 Create `.github/scripts/` directory for CI automation scripts
- [ ] T002 [P] Create `docs/wiki/` directory for wiki documentation
- [ ] T003 [P] Create `docs/archive/` directory for obsolete files
- [ ] T004 [P] Create `docs/project/` directory for implementation planning docs

**Success Criteria**: All target directories exist and are tracked in git

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before user stories can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

- [ ] T005 Create `.github/scripts/check-memory-leaks.sh` memory leak detection wrapper script
- [ ] T006 [P] Create `.github/scripts/install-valgrind.sh` platform-specific installation script
- [ ] T007 [P] Create `.github/scripts/sync-wiki.sh` wiki synchronization script
- [ ] T008 Make all scripts in `.github/scripts/` executable (chmod +x)

**Success Criteria**: All foundational scripts exist and are executable

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Project Structure Organization (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Reorganize project structure using git mv to preserve file history, with CI scripts in `.github/scripts/`, documentation organized by purpose, and user tools remaining at root

**Independent Test**: Verify all files moved to correct locations and `git log --follow` shows complete history for each moved file

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T009 [US1] Move `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt` to `docs/project/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt` using git mv
- [ ] T010 [US1] Move `README_OLD.md` to `docs/archive/README_OLD.md` using git mv
- [ ] T011 [US1] Move `README.md.backup` to `docs/archive/README.md.backup` using git mv (if exists)
- [ ] T012 [US1] Move `WIKI_READY.md` to `docs/wiki/WIKI_READY.md` using git mv
- [ ] T013 [US1] Move `WIKI_SETUP.md` to `docs/wiki/WIKI_SETUP.md` using git mv
- [ ] T014 [US1] Verify git history preserved with `git log --follow` for all moved files
- [ ] T015 [US1] Update any internal references to moved files in documentation and scripts
- [ ] T016 [US1] Commit reorganization changes with descriptive message documenting all moves

**Validation Steps**:
```bash
# Verify history preservation
git log --follow docs/project/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt
git log --follow docs/archive/README_OLD.md
git log --follow docs/wiki/WIKI_READY.md
git log --follow docs/wiki/WIKI_SETUP.md

# Verify root directory is clean
ls -la | grep -E '\.(md|txt)$' | wc -l  # Should be minimal (README.md, LICENSE, etc.)
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- All planning docs in `docs/project/`
- All obsolete files in `docs/archive/`
- All wiki docs in `docs/wiki/`
- Root contains <10 files (excluding directories)
- 100% git history preserved for all moved files

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automated Memory Leak Detection (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Implement automatic memory leak detection using valgrind (Linux) and leaks (macOS) that runs on all PRs, fails CI on any memory leaks, and provides detailed error messages with leak location

- [ ] T026 [US2] Create test scene with intentional leak for validation (temporary, for testing only)

**Validation Steps**:
```bash
# Test on Linux (if available)
.github/scripts/install-valgrind.sh
.github/scripts/check-memory-leaks.sh scenes/test/sphere.rt

# Test on macOS (if available)
.github/scripts/check-memory-leaks.sh scenes/test/sphere.rt

# Should exit with code 0 for leak-free code
echo $?
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Memory leak detection executes on all test scenes
- Zero tolerance: CI fails if any leaks detected
- Error messages include leak location within 3 lines of context
- Completes within 10 minutes per scene
- Works on both Linux (valgrind) and macOS (leaks)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

echo "# Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI workflow"
git push origin test-ci-workflow

# Monitor workflow on GitHub Actions tab
# Verify: norminette, build, test all execute

# Test PR workflow
gh pr create --title "Test PR Validation" --body "Testing workflows"
# Verify: All dev checks + memory leak detection execute
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Development workflow runs on push to dev branches (norminette + build + test)
- PR validation runs all dev checks plus memory leak detection
- Release workflow runs all checks plus artifact generation
- All workflows complete within 30 minutes for clean code
- Clear pass/fail indicators in GitHub UI
- Concurrency control prevents duplicate runs

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Automated Wiki Updates (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Implement automatic GitHub Wiki synchronization triggered by version tags, with retry logic for failures, non-blocking failure handling, and automatic issue creation on persistent failures

**Independent Test**: Create version tag and verify Wiki updates with documentation from docs/ directory, including version information, without blocking release if Wiki fails

export GITHUB_TOKEN="dummy_token"
export GITHUB_REPOSITORY="test/test"
.github/scripts/sync-wiki.sh --dry-run v1.0.0

# Test with actual tag (if wiki enabled)
git tag -a v0.0.1-test -m "Test wiki sync"
git push origin v0.0.1-test
# Monitor wiki-sync workflow on GitHub Actions
# Verify wiki updates or graceful failure
```

**Success Criteria**:

# 2. All scripts executable
ls -l .github/scripts/*.sh  # All should have +x

# 3. Git history preserved
git log --follow docs/project/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.txt  # Shows full history

# 4. Workflows configured
ls .github/workflows/*.yml  # ci.yml, pr-validation.yml, release.yml, wiki-sync.yml

# 5. Memory leak detection works
.github/scripts/check-memory-leaks.sh scenes/test/sphere.rt

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately (~15-30 min)
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories (~1-2 hours)
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Can proceed in parallel if team has capacity
  - Or sequentially in priority order: US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete (~1-2 hours)

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (Project Structure)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (~30-45 min)
- **US2 (Memory Leak Detection)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1 (~2-3 hours)
- **US3 (Quality Check Workflows)**: Can start after Foundational - May reference US2 scripts but independently testable (~2-3 hours)
- **US4 (Wiki Sync)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories (~2-3 hours)
- **US5 (Error Testing)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of other stories (~2-3 hours)

### Within Each User Story

- US1: Sequential file moves, each verified before next
- US2: Scripts in parallel, then integration testing
- US3: Workflows can be updated in parallel, then tested sequentially
- US4: Script implementation then workflow integration
- US5: Test cases can be created in parallel, script updated sequentially

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different directories)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T006, T007 can run in parallel (different scripts)

**Phase 5 (US3)**: Multiple workflow files can be edited in parallel

**Phase 7 (US5)**: T059-T063 can run in parallel (different test scene files)

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: T068, T069, T070, T075 can run in parallel (different documentation files)

**Between User Stories**: After Phase 2 completes, all user stories (US1-US5) can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 5 (Error Testing)

```bash
# Launch all error scene creation in parallel:
# Terminal 1
cat > scenes/error/no_ambient.rt << EOF
C 0,0,0 0,0,1 90
L -40,50,0 0.7 255,255,255
sp 0,0,20 20 255,0,0
EOF

# Terminal 2
cat > scenes/error/bad_camera.rt << EOF
A 0.2 255,255,255
C invalid_position 0,0,1 90
L -40,50,0 0.7 255,255,255
EOF

# Terminal 3
cat > scenes/error/negative_radius.rt << EOF
A 0.2 255,255,255
C 0,0,0 0,0,1 90
sp 0,0,20 -20 255,0,0
EOF

# All can be created simultaneously
```
