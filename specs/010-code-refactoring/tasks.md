# Tasks: Code Refactoring for Calculation Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/010-code-refactoring/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification. This is a refactoring task focused on performance optimization and code maintainability. Validation will be done through existing test infrastructure and manual scene rendering.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each optimization pattern.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `includes/`, `tests/`, `scenes/` at repository root
- All paths relative to `/Users/yoshin/dev/working/miniRT/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Baseline Validation)

**Purpose**: Establish baseline performance metrics and ensure clean starting state

- [X] T001 Create feature branch 010-code-refactoring and push to remote
- [X] T002 Run full build with make clean && make and document baseline compilation
- [X] T003 Run norminette on all target files and confirm zero violations at baseline
- [ ] T004 Run valgrind on test scenes and confirm zero memory leaks at baseline
- [ ] T005 Render all test scenes in scenes/ directory and save as reference images
- [ ] T006 Measure baseline FPS performance on scenes/benchmark.rt (or similar complex scene)
- [ ] T007 Document baseline metrics: LOC count, build time, FPS, memory usage

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Structure Updates)

**Purpose**: Core structure changes that MUST be complete before ANY optimization can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No optimization work can begin until this phase is complete

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Can start after Foundational - Most critical optimization
  - **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 completion for testing but independent implementation
  - **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Validates US1 implementation - depends on US1
  - **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Independent of US1-3, can run after Foundational
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but benefits from US1 testing
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 (validates precomputed values are used correctly)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1-3

### Within Each User Story

- User Story 1: Parsing updates BEFORE intersection updates (models before usage)
- User Story 2: Generic function implementation BEFORE call site updates BEFORE old function deletion
- User Story 3: Search tasks BEFORE updates BEFORE documentation
- User Story 4: Function creation BEFORE call site replacements
- Validation tasks MUST come after all implementation tasks within each story

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 Setup**: Tasks T002-T007 marked [P] can run in parallel (build, norminette, valgrind, rendering, benchmarks)
- **Phase 2 Foundational**: Tasks T008-T012 can be done together (structure field additions)
- **User Story 1**: Tasks T015-T019 can run in parallel (parsing updates for sphere and cylinder)
- **User Story 1**: Tasks T022-T025 can run in parallel (local variable declarations)
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T039-T041 can run in parallel (update call sites for different object types)
- **User Story 2**: Tasks T042-T044 can run in parallel (delete deprecated functions)
- **User Story 3**: Tasks T051-T053 can run in parallel (grep searches)
- **User Story 4**: Tasks T065-T066 can run in parallel (replace coordinate conversions)
- **Phase 7 Polish**: Tasks T073-T074 can run in parallel (comments and norminette)
- **Note**: Different user stories CANNOT run fully in parallel due to dependencies (US3 needs US1, testing overlaps)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 - Parsing Updates

```bash
# Launch all parsing updates together:
Task T015: "Update parse_sphere() to compute radius"
Task T016: "Update parse_sphere() to compute radius_squared"
Task T017: "Update parse_cylinder() to compute radius"
Task T018: "Update parse_cylinder() to compute radius_squared"
Task T019: "Update parse_cylinder() to compute half_height"

# Launch all local variable declarations together:
Task T022: "Add dir_dot_axis variable"
Task T023: "Add oc_dot_axis variable"
Task T024: "Add dir_dot_dir variable"
Task T025: "Add oc_dot_oc variable"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (baseline validation)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (structure updates)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (vector calculation caching)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently
   - Verify identical visual output
   - Measure FPS improvement (target: 5-15%)
   - Confirm zero memory leaks
5. Deploy/demo if ready (shows immediate performance value)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready (structure changes in place)
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → **First performance win (5-15% FPS boost)**
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → **Code maintainability win (30% less duplication)**
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → **Validation and documentation complete**
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → **Final code consolidation**
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous optimizations

### Sequential Strategy (Recommended for Solo Developer)

Since this is a refactoring task with interdependencies:

1. **Week 1**: Setup + Foundational + User Story 1
   - Most critical performance optimization
   - Measurable FPS improvement
   - Complete validation cycle
2. **Week 2**: User Story 2 + User Story 3
   - Code structure improvements
   - Validation of US1 work
3. **Week 3**: User Story 4 + Polish
   - Final consolidations
   - Complete testing and documentation

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or independent operations, no dependencies
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each user story completion (T036, T050, T062, T072)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Critical**: Maintain pixel-perfect rendering output throughout all changes
- **Critical**: Zero memory leaks required (42 School constraint)
- **Critical**: Norminette compliance required at all stages
- **No tests written**: This is pure refactoring - validation through existing test infrastructure
- Estimated total time: 6-9 hours for complete implementation and testing

### Suggested MVP Scope

**MVP = User Story 1 ONLY** (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3)
- **Deliverable**: Most critical performance optimization (vector calculation caching)
- **Measurable**: 5-15% FPS improvement
- **Timeline**: Can be completed in 1 week
- **Value**: Immediate performance benefit with minimal risk
- **Testing**: Independent validation with existing scenes

After MVP success, incrementally add US2 → US3 → US4 for full feature completion.
