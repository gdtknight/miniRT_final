# Feature Specification: Advanced Rendering Performance Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `001-rendering-optimization`  
**Created**: 2025-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "렌더링 속도가 너무 느린 문제를 해결하기 위한 최적화 기능 명세를 작성해주세요"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Parallel Ray Tracing (Priority: P1)

Users working with complex scenes (multiple objects, lights, reflections) experience unacceptably long rendering times. They need the ray tracer to utilize all available CPU cores to dramatically reduce rendering time, enabling practical work with realistic scenes.

**Why this priority**: Provides the most significant performance improvement (4-8x on typical multi-core systems) with measurable impact on user productivity. This is the foundation that makes complex scene rendering practical.

**Independent Test**: Load a scene with 20+ objects and measure rendering time. With parallel rendering enabled, rendering time should decrease proportionally to CPU core count (e.g., 4 cores = ~75% time reduction).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a scene file with 20 objects, **When** user opens it with parallel rendering enabled, **Then** rendering completes in 1/4 the time compared to single-threaded rendering on a 4-core system
2. **Given** a complex scene is rendering, **When** user checks system resource usage, **Then** all CPU cores show active utilization (>70% usage per core)
3. **Given** parallel rendering is active, **When** rendering completes, **Then** final image is identical to single-threaded rendering (no race conditions or artifacts)
4. **Given** user is adjusting camera position, **When** using low-quality preview mode, **Then** parallel rendering maintains smooth interaction with <50ms response time

### User Story 2 - Spatial Acceleration Structure (Priority: P2)

Users rendering scenes with many objects (>10) experience quadratic slowdown as ray-object intersection tests become the bottleneck. They need an efficient spatial organization that reduces unnecessary intersection tests.

**Why this priority**: Essential for scalability. Without spatial acceleration, scenes with 50+ objects become unusable. Provides 10-100x improvement for complex scenes.

**Independent Test**: Create a scene with 50 spheres. Measure rendering time with and without spatial acceleration. With acceleration enabled, rendering time should scale logarithmically rather than linearly with object count.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a scene with 50 objects, **When** rendering begins, **Then** rendering completes in <10% of the time required without spatial acceleration
2. **Given** a ray traversing empty space, **When** spatial acceleration is active, **Then** ray skips empty regions without testing every object
3. **Given** objects are densely clustered in one area, **When** ray intersects that region, **Then** only nearby objects are tested for intersection
4. **Given** scene geometry changes (object moved/added/removed), **When** spatial structure needs rebuilding, **Then** rebuild completes in <5% of total rendering time

---

### User Story 3 - Adaptive Quality Rendering (Priority: P3)

Users need to balance rendering speed and quality based on their current task. During scene setup and navigation, they need fast feedback. For final output, they need maximum quality. The system should automatically adjust quality based on user activity.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience during interactive work without sacrificing final quality. Less critical than P1/P2 as basic quality toggle already exists, but enhances workflow efficiency.

**Independent Test**: Move camera continuously for 3 seconds, then stop. During movement, rendering should use reduced quality settings. After movement stops, rendering should automatically upgrade to full quality within 1 second.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is actively moving camera, **When** frame needs rendering, **Then** system uses reduced ray samples (1 sample vs 4) and simplified shadows
2. **Given** camera movement stops, **When** 1 second elapses, **Then** system automatically re-renders at full quality
3. **Given** user is working interactively, **When** low-quality mode is active, **Then** frame rate remains above 10 FPS
4. **Given** user requests final render export, **When** rendering begins, **Then** system uses maximum quality settings regardless of previous interaction mode

---

### User Story 4 - Progressive Tile Rendering (Priority: P4)

Users rendering large or complex scenes want to see incremental progress rather than waiting for complete rendering. They need visual feedback showing which areas are complete and which are still processing.

**Why this priority**: Improves perceived performance and allows users to assess results early. Lower priority as it doesn't improve actual rendering speed, only user feedback.

**Independent Test**: Start rendering a complex scene. Verify that tiles appear progressively across the screen rather than all at once. User should see 20% of the image within 20% of total rendering time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** rendering starts, **When** 25% of render time elapses, **Then** at least 25% of screen tiles show completed rendering
2. **Given** tiles are rendering, **When** user observes the screen, **Then** tiles appear in random or spiral pattern (not top-to-bottom) for better progress perception
3. **Given** one tile has an error, **When** rendering continues, **Then** other tiles complete normally without interruption
4. **Given** user cancels rendering mid-process, **When** cancellation occurs, **Then** already-completed tiles remain visible

### Edge Cases

- What happens when scene contains no objects? System should render background/ambient only without error
- How does system handle very large scenes (1000+ objects)? Should display warning if spatial acceleration structure exceeds memory limits and gracefully degrade
- What happens if user rapidly changes settings during rendering? System should cancel current render and restart with new settings
- How does parallel rendering handle thread creation failure? Should fall back to single-threaded rendering with user notification
- What happens when object count changes during spatial structure traversal? Structure should be immutable during single frame render
- How does system handle scenes that exceed available memory? Should detect memory pressure and reduce quality automatically or show error
- What happens on single-core systems? Parallel rendering should detect core count and skip threading overhead if only 1 core available

## Assumptions

- System has at least 1 CPU core available (will detect and adapt to actual core count)
- Available memory is at least 100MB for spatial structures and rendering buffers
- 42 project rules allow pthread usage for parallel processing (standard library function)
- Scenes primarily contain spheres, planes, cylinders (geometric primitives with efficient intersection tests)
- User tolerance for low-quality preview is 1/4 resolution during interaction
- Typical scenes contain 10-50 objects (optimization targets this range for best ROI)
- CPU cores are homogeneous (equal performance) for work distribution
- Frame buffer operations are thread-safe or will be synchronized appropriately
- Scene geometry remains static during single frame render (changes trigger re-render)

## Technical Approach Priorities

Based on analysis of current implementation and constraints:

1. **Priority 1 - Parallel Ray Tracing**: Highest impact/effort ratio, directly usable on all scenes, clean implementation with pthread
2. **Priority 2 - Spatial Acceleration**: Essential for scalability, complex but well-understood algorithms (BVH)
3. **Priority 3 - Adaptive Quality**: Enhances existing low-quality mode, relatively simple state machine
4. **Priority 4 - Progressive Tiles**: User experience improvement, doesn't affect actual performance

Implementation should proceed in priority order, with each stage independently testable and delivering measurable value.
