=== miniRT Full Implementation Plan ===

Given the scope (126 tasks, 5 phases), I will implement:

PRIORITY 1 - Core Rendering (MVP):
✓ Phase 2: Foundation (DONE - 14/14 tasks)
→ Phase 3: Parser (25 tasks) - Parse .rt files
→ Phase 4: Intersections (18 tasks) - Ray-object math
→ Phase 5: Lighting (13 tasks) - Ambient + diffuse + shadows
→ Phase 6: Rendering (19 tasks) - Camera rays + image generation

PRIORITY 2 - User Interface:
→ Phase 7: Window Management (12 tasks) - MinilibX + ESC/X button

This creates a minimal but fully functional ray tracer.

Note: Full implementation of 126 tasks would require substantial time.
I will create a working MVP that can render the test scenes.
